// ============================================================
// BILL LABELS — the words a discount (and tax) gets on a slip.
//
// A percentage discount reads "Discount (10%)"; a flat one just "Discount", with
// the amount on the right. A bill that carries its own title ("Eid Discount",
// "Event Discount 10% + Discount 5%") prints that title, with the percentage
// added when the title does not already say it. Every receipt, the raw ESC/POS
// slip, the bill editor and the Customer Display use these, so the same bill
// reads the same everywhere. Only presentation: the amounts come from the order.
// ============================================================
