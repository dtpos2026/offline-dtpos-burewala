// ============================================================
// PRINT PATH PARITY — every slip type must behave the same.
//
// The POS prints four kinds of slip: the customer receipt, the KOT, the
// token and the shift report. They are built by four different components,
// and each one wires up its own print call — which is exactly how they
// drifted apart:
//
//   • printService dropped the compact flag on its window path, so Paper
//     Save worked for receipts (which call fastPrintHtml directly) but did
//     nothing for tokens, reports and test prints.
//   • The per-printer print mode was read only by the receipt path, so a
//     printer set to "Windows driver only" still had its KOT and tokens
//     pushed at the RAW path first on every single order.
//   • The shift report passed neither compact nor the printer's margins.
//
// These tests read the source of each call site and assert the options are
// actually passed. That is deliberate: the bug was never in the print
// engine, it was in four call sites forgetting to hand it the same options.
// A unit test of the engine alone would have stayed green throughout.
