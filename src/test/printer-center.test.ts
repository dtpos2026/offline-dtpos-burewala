// ============================================================
// PRINTER CENTER — the navigation, and the routing it exists to expose.
//
// Two complaints, one screen:
//
//   "Printer Center me bohat scrolling hai" — thirteen cards stacked in one
//   column, so every setting was reached by scrolling past the others.
//
//   A printer could be added, detected and test-printed successfully, and
//   every real bill still queued as Pending. The print queue resolves its
//   target from the SHOP settings, and no screen ever wrote them.
//
// These tests pin that the modules stay reachable and that the role mapping
// writes the four fields the queue actually reads. They are source-level
// because the value here is structural: a card quietly dropped from the
// module list would be a card no shop can ever reach again.
