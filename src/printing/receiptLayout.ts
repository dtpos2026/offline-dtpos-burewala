// ============================================================
// RECEIPT LAYOUT — one source of truth for how a slip sits on the paper.
//
// Why this module exists
// ----------------------
// The equal-margin fault was reported repeatedly and "fixed" repeatedly
// because the two print paths disagreed about the page box, and only one of
// them was ever measured:
//
//   raster path (printHtmlEscpos)  document IS the content width; margins are
//                                  inserted afterwards in whole printer dots.
//   driver path (printHtml)        document is the full roll; the Windows
//                                  driver prints the page as-is, so the
//                                  margins have to be real page geometry.
//
// The driver path laid the slip out at `contentMm` inside a `paperMm` page
// with NO horizontal centring, so the slip sat hard against the left edge and
// every millimetre of slack piled up on the right. Measured on an 80mm roll
// with the default 2mm margins that is 0mm left against 11.9mm right — the
// "right margin is much larger than the left" report, exactly.
//
// So both paths now describe their geometry through `resolveReceiptLayout`
// and render it through `layoutCss`, and the test suite asserts on every
// paper profile and both modes that:
//
//     equal margins in  ->  left gap === right gap   (within one printer dot)
//     left 4mm in       ->  left gap is 4mm wider than the bare head inset
//
// The second line matters as much as the first. Making the slip symmetric was
// only ever half the job; a shop also has to be able to nudge it, because the
// roll does not always sit the same way in every machine.
//
// One data model, two renderers
// -----------------------------
// `ReceiptLayout` is also what the ESC/POS builder reads for its `GS L`
// (left margin) and `GS W` (print area width), so an HTML slip and a raw
// slip are positioned by the same numbers rather than two guesses.

 * every shop with a slightly differently-seated roll has to repeat it.

 * the same clamps the resolver does, and hands back the two numbers to save.

 * What it will NOT quietly absorb
 * -------------------------------
 * If the two measured gaps do not ADD UP to the blank paper this layout
 * should be leaving, the slip is not merely off-centre — it is printing at
 * the wrong width, which is a paper profile or a driver scaling fault that
 * moving margins cannot fix and would only disguise. That is reported as
